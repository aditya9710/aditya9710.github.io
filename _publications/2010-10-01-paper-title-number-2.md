excerpt: 'Educational Robotics holds the potential to promote the development of important 21st century
skills, such as creativity and problem-solving skills in addition to digital literacy. However, the emergence
of the Covid-19 pandemic has posed particular obstacles that had to be overcome in order to allow
Educational Robotics activities to be conducted in distance learning. In the first place, the obligation to
work from home limited the access to required equipment for many students. Secondly, many teachers
had to face the novel challenge of creating pedagogically meaningful activities in online learning formats.
Aiming to address these challenges, this work explored maker-based approaches as a way to implement
Educational Robotics activities in online learning. The devised tools and activities were evaluated in two
case studies performed with (i) high school students participating in a mobile robotics summer school and
(ii) in-service teachers attending a professional development course on Educational Robotics. The teachers’
and students’ perception of the proposed activities was analyzed using online surveys and video interviews.
The findings showed that the combination of the devised tools and activities allowed teachers and students
to explore the basics of mobile robotics while helping them develop a maker mindset. The use of ubiquitous
construction materials and affordable electronic components promotes the accessibility of the approach. The
proposed tools and activities may therefore provide an exemplary framework for more general applications
of Educational Robotics in online learning that go beyond the context of emergency remote teaching.'
