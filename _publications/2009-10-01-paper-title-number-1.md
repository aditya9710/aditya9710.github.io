excerpt: 'Past research has shown that the use of tangible programming
platforms in computing education can enhance students’ interest, engagement, and collaboration within workgroups. However,
to this day, the adoption of such interfaces in classrooms has remained relatively scarce. This is possibly due to the expenses and
efforts necessary to acquire, set up and maintain such platforms. In
this context, the use of paper as a principal means of interaction
represents an inexpensive and versatile solution, that additionally
harnesses the prevalence of paper in classrooms. This work, therefore, introduces PaPL, an easily reproducible platform for paperbased programming languages. The platform was evaluated in two
exploratory user studies. The first study aimed at investigating
the interaction of over 100 senior year high school students with
the platform under varying conditions of group size and usage
constraints. In the second study, the platform was tested with 32
sixth-graders and 2 teachers to evaluate its usage in an authentic
context. The results indicate that group size may affect active discussion and error count, while usage constraints may affect active
discussion of students interacting with the platform. Moreover, the
classroom study shows promising results with regard to the use of
PaPL in formal education.'
