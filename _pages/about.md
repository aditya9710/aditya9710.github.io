Hey! I’m Aditya, a student at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’ll be graduating in July 2023 with a Masters of Science in Robotics Engineering. I possess strong experience in development projects in a wide variety of applications. This came significantly from working with fast-paced startups, public sector companies, international research labs, and student teams on biomedical rehabilitation, aviation, automobile, educational, social, industrial, and warehouse robotics industries.

I’m looking for full-time opportunities beginning Fall 2023 to build more scalable robotic solutions with perception-based approaches. Outside of work and school, I enjoy watching movies, hiking, kayaking and have also performed improvisation acts internationally in house full shows.
